# Staking

Help Secure the Cosmos Hub and Earn Rewards

## What is Staking?

Staking is the process of locking up a digital asset (ATOMs in the case of the Cosmos Hub) in order to provide economic security for a public blockchain.

- **Help Secure the Chain:** Locking up ATOMs unlocks a special power to elect validators who operate the network. 
- **Earn Rewards:** Select one or more validators of the Cosmos Hub and start earning crypto assets.
- **Vote for the Future:** Staking ATOMs grants the right to vote on proposals and make decisions on the future of the network. (link to faq)

## How can I stake ATOMs?

1. Get ATOMs via one of the many cryptocurrency exchanges.

2. Choose one or more validators to delegate to
Validators operate the machines that run the network. Their number is limited to 125.
They are elected based on the amount of ATOMs delegated to them.
They never get custody of the ATOMs delegated to them. However, there are [risks] associated with staking with validators.

3. Using a [Wallet], send a simple transaction (often called “Stake” or “Delegate”) to start staking. This locks up your ATOMs and enables the chosen validators to operate the network. 

(ℹ) ATOMs can be unlocked by sending a transaction (often called “Unstake” or “Undelegate”) and waiting 21 days.

## Staking Rewards

When the staking transaction is complete, rewards will start generating immediately. At any time, stakers can send a transaction to claim their accumulated rewards, using a wallet.

- **Newly created ATOMs:** The total supply of ATOMs is inflated to reward stakers. ATOM holders that do not stake do not receive rewards, meaning their ATOMs get diluted over time.
The yearly inflation rate of ATOMs is available on most explorers.
- **Transaction Fee:** Transaction fees collected on the Cosmos Hub are distributed to staked ATOM holders.

## Staking Risks

Staking ATOMs is not risk-free. When ATOM holders stake, they need to choose one or more validators to delegate to. However, if a validator performs badly (according to the protocol), up to 5% of ATOMs delegated to them can be forfeited. For more on protocol faults, see [FAQ RISKS].
