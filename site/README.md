# Cosmos Hub

The Cosmos Hub is the first of [thousands of interconnected blockchains](https://cosmos.network) that will eventually comprise the **Interchain**. The primary token of the Cosmos Hub is the **ATOM**.

## The ATOM

Do you have ATOM tokens? With ATOM, you have the superpower to contribute to the security and governance of the Cosmos Hub. Delegate your ATOM to one or more of the 100 validators on the Cosmos Hub blockchain to earn more ATOM through Proof-of-Stake. You can also vote with your ATOM to influence the future of the Cosmos Hub through on-chain governance proposals.

Learn more about [being a delegator](/intro/delegator-faq.html), learn about [the security risks](/intro/delegator-security.html), and start participating with one of the following wallets.

## Cosmos Hub Wallets

These user-friendly web and mobile wallets allow you to store & transfer ATOM, delegate ATOM to validators, and vote on on-chain governance proposals.
