# Cosmos Hub

Welcome to the Cosmos Hub! The Hub is the first of [millions of interconnected blockchains](https://cosmos.network) that will eventually become the interchain. The token of the Cosmos Hub is the ATOM.

Did you just obtain some ATOM? With ATOM, you now now have the superpower to directly contribute to the security and governance of the Cosmos Hub. You can become a [delegator](./en/intro/delegator-faq), and delegate your ATOM to one of the 100 validators on the blockchain to earn rewards. You can also vote your ATOM to influence the future of the Cosmos Hub through governance proposals.

Learn more about [being a delegator](/en/intro/delegator-faq), learn about [the security risks](/en/intro/delegator-security), and start participating with one of the following wallets.
